        <h2>An Excerpt From Sherlock Holmes</h2>

        <div>
          <p>
            When I went down there I found him talking with his son, so I smoked
            a cigar and waited behind a tree until he should be alone. But as I
            listened to his talk all that was black and bitter in me seemed to
            come uppermost. He was urging his son to marry my daughter with as
            little regard for what she might think as if she were a slut from
            off the streets. It drove me mad to think that I and all that I held
            most dear should be in the power of such a man as this. Could I not
            snap the bond? I was already a dying and a desperate man. Though
            clear of mind and fairly strong of limb, I knew that my own fate was
            sealed. But my memory and my girl! Both could be saved if I could
            but silence that foul tongue. I did it, Mr. Holmes. I would do it
            again. Deeply as I have sinned, I have led a life of martyrdom to
            atone for it. But that my girl should be entangled in the same
            meshes which held me was more than I could suffer. I struck him down
            with no more compunction than if he had been some foul and venomous
            beast. His cry brought back his son; but I had gained the cover of
            the wood, though I was forced to go back to fetch the cloak which I
            had dropped in my flight. That is the true story, gentlemen, of all
            that occurred."
          </p>

          <p>
            "Well, it is not for me to judge you," said Holmes as the old man
            signed the statement which had been drawn out. "I pray that we may
            never be exposed to such a temptation."
          </p>

          <p>"I pray not, sir. And what do you intend to do?"</p>

          <p>
            "In view of your health, nothing. You are yourself aware that you
            will soon have to answer for your deed at a higher court than the
            Assizes. I will keep your confession, and if McCarthy is condemned I
            shall be forced to use it. If not, it shall never be seen by mortal
            eye; and your secret, whether you be alive or dead, shall be safe
            with us."
          </p>

          <p>
            "Farewell, then," said the old man solemnly. "Your own deathbeds,
            when they come, will be the easier for the thought of the peace
            which you have given to mine." Tottering and shaking in all his
            giant frame, he stumbled slowly from the room.
          </p>

          <p>
            "God help us!" said Holmes after a long silence. "Why does fate play
            such tricks with poor, helpless worms? I never hear of such a case
            as this that I do not think of Baxter's words, and say, 'There, but
            for the grace of God, goes Sherlock Holmes.'"
          </p>

          <p>
            James McCarthy was acquitted at the Assizes on the strength of a
            number of objections which had been drawn out by Holmes and
            submitted to the defending counsel. Old Turner lived for seven
            months after our interview, but he is now dead; and there is every
            prospect that the son and daughter may come to live happily together
            in ignorance of the black cloud which rests upon their past.
          </p>

          <p>
            When I glance over my notes and records of the Sherlock Holmes cases
            between the years '82 and '90, I am faced by so many which present
            strange and interesting features that it is no easy matter to know
            which to choose and which to leave. Some, however, have already
            gained publicity through the papers, and others have not offered a
            field for those peculiar qualities which my friend possessed in so
            high a degree, and which it is the object of these papers to
            illustrate. Some, too, have baffled his analytical skill, and would
            be, as narratives, beginnings without an ending, while others have
            been but partially cleared up, and have their explanations founded
            rather upon conjecture and surmise than on that absolute logical
            proof which was so dear to him. There is, however, one of these last
            which was so remarkable in its details and so startling in its
            results that I am tempted to give some account of it in spite of the
            fact that there are points in connection with it which never have
            been, and probably never will be, entirely cleared up.
